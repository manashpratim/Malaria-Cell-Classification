# Malaria-Cell-Classification
Save humans by detecting Image Cells that contain Malaria or not!
# Description
In this project, I have used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify Malaria cell images as Parasitized or Uinfected. The dataset is available at https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/. I have split the dataset into 90% training and 10% validation sets. The total number of training and testing images are 24802 and 2756 respectively. The dataset contains equal number of images in both the classes. I have implemented the code using tensorflow and keras. I have obtained a validation accuaracy of over 95% training for 10 epochs only.
